This project is a simple interactive chatbot built with Streamlit and the Gemini Pro model from Google's Generative AI.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API key like so: `Google_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`.

## Usage

The chatbot is very simple to use. Just type your question into the text input field and click the "Ask Question" button. The chatbot's response will be displayed below.

You can also upload an image, and the chatbot will attempt to classify it. Please note that the image classification feature is currently a placeholder and does not actually classify images.
